***Maps to black freedom*** is a blog reflecting my research & other adventures as an organizer & grad student.  My maps are made using open-source data so the information is free for anyone to use.  Please feel free to share widely.  I use R, an open-source software, to make these maps.  You can find all my code to make the maps & build this website on my [github page](https://github.com/miakd/). 

My work is made possible by inspiration & guidance from my mentors & friends in Black Lives Matter Sacramento & the UC Davis Geography Graduate Group, as well as support from the Robert & Patricia Switzer Foundation, the Mellon Research Initiative on Racial Capitalism, the Society of Women Geographers, & the Henry A. Jastro Scholarship.
