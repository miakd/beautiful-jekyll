***Maps to black freedom*** is a blog reflecting my research & other adventures as an organizer and grad student.  My maps are made using open-source data so the information is free for anyone to use.  Please feel free to share widely.  I use R, an open-source software, to make these maps.  You can find all my code to make the maps & build this website on my [github page](https://github.com/miakd/). 

My work is made possible by inspiration and guidance from my mentors and friends in Black Lives Matter Sacramento and the UC Davis Geography Graduate Group, as well as support from the Robert & Patricia Switzer Foundation, the Mellon Research Initiative on Racial Capitalism, the Society of Women Geographers, and the Henry A. Jastro Scholarship.
