***Don't speak the language: geographies of resistance*** is my effort to reflect on both the substance and process of my research on environmental justice. As I work to understand how race, environment, and technoscience are conceptualized and operationalized in the U.S., I would like to bring you along on the journey. I welcome your beef, feedback, and questions. Let's learn something from each other.

The blog will include short essays and maps.  My maps are made using open-source data meaning that information is free for anyone to use.  Please feel free to share widely.  I use R, an open-source software, to make these maps.  You can find all my code to make the maps and build this website on my [github page](https://github.com/miakd/).  In the *food for thought* tab on the top left of the site, you can find the reading, music, podcasts, and films that inspire the work you see in the blog.

My work is made possible by the inspiration and support of my mentors and colleagues in the UC Davis Geography Graduate Group, as well as funding from the [Robert & Patricia Switzer Foundation](http://www.switzernetwork.org/become-fellow/2017-switzer-fellows), the [Society of Women Geographers](http://www.iswg.org/fellowships/current-fellowship-winners), and the Henry A. Jastro scholarship fund.  I am grateful the people in these groups and beyond who have encouraged me and engaged with my work.  All views represented in the blog are my own.
