abolition.atlas reflects my research with and for the movement for police/prison abolition in Sacramento and beyond.  My maps are made using open-source data so the information is free for anyone to use.  Please feel free to share widely.  I use R, an open-source software, to make these maps.  You can find all my code to make the maps & build this website on my [github page](https://github.com/miakd/). 

My work is made possible by inspiration & guidance from my mentors & friends in Black Lives Matter Sacramento & at UC Davis, as well as support from the Robert & Patricia Switzer Foundation, the Mellon Public Scholars Program, the Mellon Research Initiative on Racial Capitalism, the Society of Women Geographers, & the Henry A. Jastro Scholarship.
