***Don't speak the language: geographies of resistance*** is my effort to reflect on both the substance and process of my research on environmental justice. As I work to understand how race, environment, and technoscience are conceptualized and operationalized in the U.S., I would like to bring you along on the journey. I welcome your beef, feedback, and questions. Let's learn something from each other.

The blog will include short essays and maps.  My maps are made using open-source data meaning that information is free for anyone to use.  Please feel free to share widely.  I use R, an open-source software, to make these maps.  You can find all my code on my [github page](https://github.com/miakd/).  In the *Food for thought* tab on the top left of the site, you can find the reading, music, podcasts, and films that inspire the work you see in the blog.
