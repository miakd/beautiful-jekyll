abolition.atlas is a collection of geographic musings reflecting my work with and for the movement for police/prison abolition in Sacramento and beyond.

My work is made possible by inspiration & guidance from my mentors & friends in Black Lives Matter Sacramento & at UC Davis, as well as support from the Robert & Patricia Switzer Foundation, the Mellon Public Scholars Program, the Mellon Research Initiative on Racial Capitalism, the Society of Women Geographers, & the Henry A. Jastro Scholarship.

Maps are made using open source software and data.  Please use and share widely. You can find all my code to make the maps & build this website on my [github page](https://github.com/miakd/).
