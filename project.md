*Don't speak the language: geographies of resistance* is my effort to reflect on both the substance and process of my research on environmental justice. As I work to understand how race, environment, and technoscience are conceptualized and operationalized in the U.S., I would like to bring you along on the journey. I welcome your beef, feedback, and questions. Let's learn something from each other.

I believe that language, philosophy, and action are inseparable from one another. To take liberatory action, we must first deconstruct the deeply rooted assumptions coded into our understandings of each other and the world. We must keep only what serves our collective struggle and we must build new understanding to replace what we have shed. We need philosophies and languages of resistance.

I use geography to approach this radical re-envisionment, because it allows for the study of human society as connected to the rest of the biological world and the physical world (with the added bonus of being recognized by U.S. universities). It allows for holistic thought about these phenomena, which are inevitably oversimplified when we attempt to separate them. In searching for new language for these phenomena, I hope to better envision, communicate, and embody liberatory action in my community.
