funkepistemology is a selection of words, maps, audio, and images, documenting my worldview, my personal evolution, and my progress towards a notoriosly tricky degree.

My work is made possible by inspiration & guidance from my mentors & friends in my circles at UC Davis, in Sacramento for Black Lives, in Still Here: Collective for Trans Rights. I have received support from as well as support from the Robert & Patricia Switzer Foundation, the Mellon Public Scholars Program, the Mellon Research Initiative on Racial Capitalism, the Society of Women Geographers, and the UC Davis Feminist Research Institute.

The website is hosted through github, all maps are open source, and everything is sharable.  Donations are always welcomed and appreciated.  Please send me an email if you want to discuss supporting a specific aspect of the work.
