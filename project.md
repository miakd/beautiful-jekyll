***Don't speak the language: geographies of resistance*** is my effort to share research products and reflections on my adventures as an organizer and grad studnet. As I work to carve out this path, I would love to bring you along on the journey. I welcome your beef, feedback, and questions. Let's learn something from each other.

The blog will include short essays and maps.  My maps are made using open-source data meaning that information is free for anyone to use.  Please feel free to share widely.  I use R, an open-source software, to make these maps.  You can find all my code to make the maps and build this website on my [github page](https://github.com/miakd/).  In the *food for thought* tab on the top left of the site, you can find the reading, music, podcasts, and films that inspire the work you see in the blog.

My work is made possible by inspiration and guidance from my mentors and friends in Black Lives Matter Sacramento and the UC Davis Geography Graduate Group, as well as support from the Robert & Patricia Switzer Foundation, the Society of Women Geographers, and the Henry A. Jastro Scholarship.  All views represented in the blog are my own.
