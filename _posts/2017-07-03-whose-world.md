Growing up, my older brother kept my family supplied with music.  His collection has been on point since the days of Sony Walkman and CD players, and he has always been ready with music for any occasion.  He would learn entire raps by Nas and A Tribe Called Quest by heart, and I ***loved*** when he got me to be his back up.  When he'd say, *Hey Fife, you gettin' fat!*, I was ready with *Yeah, I know it looks pathetic! Ali Shaheed Muhammad got me doin' calistenics'.*

One of our favorite songs around that time was [*The world is yours*]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_srvHOu75vM) by Nas featuring Pete Rock.  Between verses about the grittiness of life as a black man in the New York City projects, there is an joyful chorus in the form of a call-and-response between the two artists: 

>Pete Rock: *Whose world is this?* / Nas: *The world is yours!* / Pete Rock: *It's mine, it's mine, it's mine.*
