Growing up, my older brother kept my family supplied with music.  His collection has been on point since the days of Sony Walkman and CD players, and he has always been ready with music for any occasion.  He would learn entire raps by Nas and A Tribe Called Quest by heart, and I ***loved*** when he got me to be his back up.  When he'd say, *Hey Fife, you gettin' fat!*, I was ready with *Yeah, I know it looks pathetic! Ali Shaheed Muhammad got me doin' calistenics'.*

One of our favorite songs around that time was [*The world is yours*]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_srvHOu75vM) by Nas featuring Pete Rock.  Between verses about the grittiness of life as a black man in the New York City projects, there is a chorus in the form of a call-and-response between the two artists: *(Pete Rock) Whose world is this? / (Nas) The world is yours! / Pete Rock: It's mine, it's mine, it's mine.*  In the chorus, the artists transcend the circumstances described in the verses.  They affirm what their society denies them at every turn: that they can lay claim to any part of this planet.  Their statement is radical.  The legacy of slavery lives on in the U.S.<sup>1</sup>, and many of us are denied sovereignty even over our own bodies.  Nas uses the verses to deftly describes this brutal reality, shouting out incarcerated friends and reminding us all that we are one thousand miles from home.  But then, again and again, he tells us that the world is ours.

As a black feminist geographer, this tension between the gritty and the uplifting is familiar, and my hope is to handle it with similar grace.  The gritty reality is always there, from police brutality and hate crimes to the slow violence<sup>2</sup> of environmental toxicity and lack of access to health care.  There are geographies of oppression here that I am working to bring to light.  At the same time, I want my work to celebrate blackness, queerness, and femininity.  Althought those of us who relate to these identities endure intersecting layers of oppression, we are living our lives loudly and making more than the most of what we've got.  We are a well-spring of creativity and radical consciousness.  We know that the world is ours and that's why we're fighting for it.
