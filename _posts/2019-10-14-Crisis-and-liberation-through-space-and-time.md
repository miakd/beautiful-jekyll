subtitle: A conversation with Neil Agarwal
---

Neil and I sat down and spoke in July about his forthcoming book, Yellowing the Logarithm: Money, Value and the Political Economy of Racial Capitalism, which focuses on the establishment of capitalism in early America as a racial project in which money plays a central role.  This is an excerpt of a longer conversation on that day and more broadly spanning a year of collaboration through the UC Davis Racial Capitalism Research Initiative and an American Association of Geographers Panel Series on Racial Regimes of Property.
