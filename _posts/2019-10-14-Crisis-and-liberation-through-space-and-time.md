Neil and I sat down and spoke in July about his forthcoming book, Yellowing the Logarithm: Money, Value and the Political Economy of Racial Capitalism, which focuses on the establishment of capitalism in early America as a racial project in which money plays a central role.  This is an excerpt of a longer conversation on that day and more broadly spanning a year of collaboration through the UC Davis Racial Capitalism Research Initiative and an American Association of Geographers Panel Series on Racial Regimes of Property. 

*****

**Neil**: I was having this conversation with somebody about the idea of inevitability. About how old-school Marxists sometimes seem to write as if they are saying, "Well, capitalism is inevitably going to fail." That if you look at the logic of capital, and its contradictions, then there is no other possibility but for the system to collapse. There's this sense of inevitability to it. Which people have rightly criticized, because it can lead to a kind of passivist politics. That some outcome will eventually happen, regardless of our individual actions. 

One of the things I find exciting about your writing---and I think this is true of others who are also grounded in organizing work---is that you seem to to make sense of our present by writing from the perspective of a possible future that will be. 

**Mia Karisa**: Yeah. Okay. Actually, I thought about this a lot. I have this whole spiel I did about afrofuturism and radical geography, so I'll try to condense that.

**Neil**: Please.

**Mia Karisa**: So the idea of capitalism being destined to fail is super fucking white to me. Capitalism is failure and capitalism is death. Capitalism has been killing people and killing the planet since the jump, let's say. So saying it's destined to fail is it's not working now has to come from a privileged position-- what you’re really saying is it's working for me now but, one day, it's going to kill us all. But from the position of those are being utterly failed by capitalism already, we can't afford that luxury.  Adrienne Maree Brown speaks to that in How to Survive the End of the World<sup>1</sup>. Her concept that we're currently surviving or living in an apocalypse-- I think that's useful. 

If we think about all of this spatially a bit more, rather than thinking about it temporally, we can see that capitalism is here, materially. We can feel it and taste it and choke on it. But these other systems and these other ways of living are necessarily also here because if capitalism was the only thing that existed, we would all be ash. We would just crumble.  There has to be care. There has to be nurturing. There have to be things like the funk, I guess, that exist outside of capitalism and that provide some type of life force. And those things exist now. 

So I think that's why I find Ruth Gilmore's abolition geographies concept really important<sup>2</sup>. Because that's what she does.  When she talks about abolition geographies, abolition isn't treated a process that will one day reach success but hasn’t yet.  Instead it’s something that's in constant struggle and that is successful now. Abolition is working. Abolition has been working. It's just up against a lot. So, I mean, we don't see it everywhere, but we do see it in certain places and it's alive and well. Liberation exists already, there isn’t anything pie-in-the-sky about it.

**Neil**: I'm with you on that. So, you develop direct action in your work as both theory and method. That the way we come to know the logics of capitalism, or racial capitalism is in their manifestation through and against black spatial praxis, in the abolition work of BLM Sacramento. There is a line often quoted from Marx that the point is not merely to understand the world, but to change it; and I think your work points us to a stronger version of the materialist perspective, in which it is only through changing the world that we come to fully understand it.

I have a related question which I'd like for us to talk about on the relationship between scholarship and activism. Ruthie Gilmore, to continue on this thread of abolition geography, says about scholarship that "the point is not just to be right, the point is to get free."<sup>3</sup> And I'm wondering if we can talk about how we approach our scholarly work as a freedom practice. 

**Mia Karisa**: Yeah. I resonate with that a lot, and I definitely feel like my work is trying to get free. That's my goal. I'm more in the social constructionist there-is-no-such-thing-as-right-or-wrong camp. I don't mean morally right or wrong. That's a whole different conversation. But I mean correct or incorrect.  So first of all, most activists don't call themselves activists. And "organizing" feels like a more comfortable term for me to use. And in terms of who I am as a scholar, and who I am as an organizer feels completely synonymous. Not different at all. My relationship to this degree and to the UC, to UCD, is mentorship and resources to do the organizing and to write about it, and to change my understanding of the world and myself. And all of those things are oriented towards getting free.

**Neil**: And then moving from scholarship in general, to questions of academia in particular. I want to bring in a distinction Mariame Kaba makes between activism and organizing.<sup>4</sup> The distinction turns on the question of accountability.  Quoting Kaba, activism "only demands that you personally take on the issue. That means signing petitions. Being on a board of a particular organization that’s doing good in the world." It’s about taking the position that "I’m just an activist and I just do things on my own. I don’t have anybody who is a base for me, and nobody holds me accountable.'" 

Being an organizer means that you have people counting on you. Organizers "can’t exist solo. Because who the hell are you organizing? You can’t just decide to wake up one morning and be like, I’m just going to do this shit.' If you’re organizing, other people are counting on you, but more importantly, your actions are accountable to somebody else."

You have insisted on this before too. About how your work is as an organizer, not activist. I'd like for us to think about what this distinction would mean for scholarly work. As a way of approaching the question of what it might mean to think about our scholarship and scholarly practice as about "getting free." The term "scholar-activist" is often taken up. Which I think fits within the individualizing demands of academia. But what would it mean to be a "scholar-organizer"? Who are we holding ourselves accountable to? Dissertation advisors, hiring committees, and fellowship granters. But how? The dominant forms of accountability that structure these situations are so bound up with institutional aspects of academia that we can both be skeptical of. But I think we'd agree that we are held accountable to mentors in ways that go beyond professional requirements. What are more radical imaginings of dependency through which we can hold ourselves and our knowledge practices accountable? What is our "base"? I don't think this is simply about one's readership.

**Mia Karisa**: I think the emphasis on organizers being accountable to one another is crucial-- whether we are organizing within or outside the academy, or organizing across that dividing line.  And that radical love and accountability among organizers is exciting when it happens but its also one of the biggest challenges of working for transformation, because it means acknowledging that none of us are perfect.  We are all capable of causing harm no matter how many marginalized identities we hold, and we have to be willing to take feedback and actually change our habits and behaviors.  That kind of growth is what keeps me in it but it’s also scary and vulnerable and all the things.  

I'll also reference Clyde Woods here and a concept from his larger idea of blues epistemology. This work helps articulate that the knowledge we need to get free is not generated in any elite academic spaces, but rather that it comes from the “university of the streets”.   And those of us in academia who are trying to do radical work are lifted up by that knowledge but that is produced elsewhere, outside any western institutions.
