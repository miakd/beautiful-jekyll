Much more reading is coming your way soon.  Here is a short list of what I'm chewing on.  For my favorite authors, instead of choosing titles, I'll just say "***everything!***".

### Non-fiction ###

Anzaldúa, Gloria E., and Cherríe Moraga: *This bridge called my back*

Brand, Dionne: *A map to the door of no return*

Said, Edward: *Orientalism*

Mock, Janet: *Redefining realness*

Haraway, Donna: *Simians, Cyborgs, and Women: The Reinvention of Nature*

Pullido, Laura: ***everything!***

McKitterick, Katherine: ***everything!***

Also, here is 10 pages of black geography reading as part of this [syllabus](http://geography.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Geog251Spring2017.pdf) compiled by Jovan Lewis.  Get into it, family.

### Fiction ###

Butler, Octavia: ***everything!***

Rankine, Claudia: ***everything!***
