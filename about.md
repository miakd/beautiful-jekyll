~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~![](/img/mia_.jpg)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I am an organizer for black and trans liberation in Sacramento & a Ph.D. student in the UC Davis Geography Graduate Group with a designated emphasis in Black Studies. I place myself in a lineage of abolition, black/trans insurrection, and marxism.  All of my efforts as an organizer, researcher, & educator, are trauma-informed.  They are also evolving towards raising spirituality/consciousness, both my own and others. My human geographic approach is in conversation with black/queer/feminist studies, science & technology studies, and ecology.
