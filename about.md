Mia Karisa is black trans & jewish individual and a geographer and organizer with eyes only for liberation. They ground their work in a lineage of abolition, black & trans insurrection, and Marxism.

They organize with Sacramento for Black Lives and Still Here: Alliance for Trans Rights, and they're a Ph.D. student in the Geography Graduate Group at the University of California, Davis with a designated emphasis in African American Studies.  Their human geographic approach is in conversation with black, queer, & feminist studies, science & technology studies, and ecology.  As writer and teacher, they aim to foster and celebrate black, queer, and trans space while defying disciplines, smashing respectability politics, and transcending borders. 

Their work has been supported by the Robert & Patricia Switzer Foundation, the Mellon Public Scholars Program, the Mellon Research Initiative on Racial Capitalism, the Society of Women Geographers, and the UC Davis Feminist Research Institute.
