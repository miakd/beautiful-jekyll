I am an organizer and data/mapping lead with Black Lives Matter Sacramento & a Ph.D. student in the UC Davis Geography Graduate Group with a designated emphasis in Black Studies.  My work seeks to reimagine relationships between race, gender, science/tech, power & authority.  I ground my work in queer black feminism first and foremost.  My guiding light is the liberation of queer black people worldwide; as elaborated in the [Combahee River Collective Statement](http://circuitous.org/scraps/combahee.html), this will mean the liberation of the rest of our human species along the way.

I am guided by a conviction that language, philosophy, & action are inseparable from one another. To take liberatory action, we must first deconstruct the tightly held assumptions in our understandings of each other & the world, which are too often rooted in white supremacy. We must build new understandings to replace what we have shed. We need philosophies & languages of liberation.

A human geography lens allows me to consider problems in human society in connection with larger biological and physical worlds. Human geography-- in conversation with black/queer/feminist studies & art, as well as science & techonology studies-- allows me to think holistically about these phenomena, which are inevitably oversimplified when we attempt to separate them. In searching for new language for these phenomena, I hope to better envision, communicate, and actualize black liberation in my community.
