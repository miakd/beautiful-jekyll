~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~![](/img/mia_.jpg)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I am a geographer and organizer with eyes only for liberation. I ground my work in a lineage of abolition, black & trans insurrection, and Marxism.

I organize with Sacramento for Black Lives and Still Here: Alliance for Trans Rights. I'm a Ph.D. student in the Geography Graduate Group at the University of California, Davis with a designated emphasis in African American Studies.  My work as an organizer, researcher, and educator, is trauma-informed and spiritually grounded.  My human geographic approach is in conversation with black, queer, & feminist studies, science & technology studies, and ecology.

I earned my BA from Oberlin College where I studied biology and geology. After graduating, I worked with the Bureau of Land Management in El Dorado Hills, CA, on Seeds of Success, a nationwide native plant restoration program.  My love for maps and places and my thirst for justice led me to pursue graduate study in human geography. 

My work has been supported by the Robert & Patricia Switzer Foundation, the Mellon Public Scholars Program, the Mellon Research Initiative on Racial Capitalism, the Society of Women Geographers, and the UC Davis Feminist Research Institute.
