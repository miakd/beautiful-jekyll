~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~![](/img/mia_.jpg)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I am an organizer & research lead with Black Lives Matter Sacramento & a Ph.D. student in the UC Davis Geography Graduate Group with a designated emphasis in Black Studies. In my capacities as an organizer, researcher, & student/teacher, I strive for liberation through abolition. My human geographic approach is in conversation with black/queer/feminist studies & art, science & technology studies and environmental justice.
