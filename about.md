I am a student and activist working to reimagine the relationship between race, environment and technoscience.  I am currently in the Geography Graduate Group at the University of California, Davis. I ground my work in black feminism first and foremost.  My guiding light is the liberation of queer black people women and non-binary folks; as elaborated in [the Combahee River Collective Statement](http://circuitous.org/scraps/combahee.html), this will mean the liberation of everyone else along the way.

I believe that language, philosophy, and action are inseparable from one another. To take liberatory action, we must first deconstruct the deeply rooted assumptions coded into our understandings of each other and the world. We must keep only what serves our collective struggle and we must build new understanding to replace what we have shed. We need philosophies and languages of resistance.

I use geography to approach this radical re-envisionment, because it allows for the study of human society as connected to the rest of the biological world and the physical world (with the added bonus of being recognized by U.S. universities). It allows for holistic thought about these phenomena, which are inevitably oversimplified when we attempt to separate them. In searching for new language for these phenomena, I hope to better envision, communicate, and embody liberatory action in my community.
