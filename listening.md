Much more to come soon!  

For now: [Two Dope Queens](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/dopequeens) is a hilarious podcast led by Jessica Williams and Pheobe Robinson that tends to improve my outlook on life.  For more serious discussions of race led by a team of six people of color (very NPR-flavored!), get down with [Code Switch](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510312/codeswitch) podcast.

As for music, for now I will just say that [DJ Logon's playlists](https://www.mixcloud.com/bestpon2foot/) got me through my first year of late night grad school work.  Please turn up responsibly.
